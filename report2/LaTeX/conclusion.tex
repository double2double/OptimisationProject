\section{Conclusion}
A lot of assumptions have been made throughout the creation of the model. Most of these are oversimplifications of the real world and we barley scratched the surface of the real optimisation problem behind the airplane. 
Things we did not include in the model are for example a minimum speed
and a maximum speed for the air plane. We only optimised the residual energy at the end of the flight, but did not enforce conditions on the energy levels of the air plane. The same applies to the speed of the plane. In order to prevent the plane from reaching dangerously low or high speeds, constraints should be enforced here as well. Possibly we can make the weather more realistic and time varying as well? If we did so than t[0] = would no longer be a fixed condition. Which gives rise to the question of finding the ideal time of departure. Furthermore we could take a closer look at the flight hight. Since at higher altitudes the solar panels of the plane work more efficiently.
