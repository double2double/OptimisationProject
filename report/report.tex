\chapter{Motivation and Implementation}
\section{Introduction}
In this project we are going to find the optimal path for a solar powered airplane \footnote{Like the one from \url{http://www.solarimpulse.com/}}. During flight the plane's electrical engines drain power from it's battery, while at the same time solar panels on the plane's wings convert energy from the sun's rays into electric energy. However clouds may block the sun's rays from reaching the panels. In addition the suns intensity increases when flying closer to the earth's equator. In order to keep as much energy in the planes batteries as possible the flight path has to be optimized.

\section{Problem formulation and Analysis}
In the optimization process we use randomly generated weather data and sun data corresponding to a flight between $48^\circ$ and $50^\circ$ latitude. We generate the weather data by cubicly interpolating a random matrix of size \texttt{n} over a grid. The larger n becomes the more complex the weather will be. This functionality is implemented in \texttt{Static\_Weather.m} \footnote{All matlab code can be found on \url{https://github.com/double2double/OptimisationProject/} in the MATLAB folder.} The class returns a weather data matrix $W$.
Data for the sun comes from a couple of established equations that relate the local time and position to the sun's intensity  which happens in \texttt{sun.m}. The class returns a sun data Matrix $S$. We define low values in the weather Data Matrix as cloudy and high values as sunny weather. As clouds reduce the electric yield of our plane's solar cells we define the overall intensity as:
\begin{equation}
$I$ \:= \: $W$ .* $S$
\end{equation}
While following a convention where $.*$ denotes element wise multiplication we end up with an intensity matrix $I$, which contains sun intensity data weighted according to the random weather.

Next we took a closer look at the airplane. Here we consider the degree to which the plane can recharge its battery during flight, which is the path integral over the intensity data:
\begin{equation}
\oint_{path}
\end{equation}
